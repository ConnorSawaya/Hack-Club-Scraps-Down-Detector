# Hack-Club-Scraps-Down-Detector
Hack Club Scraps Down Detector simple and uses streamlit
uses requests to check for codes of things like working partial error or no response(or down)

Might expand to use any website but for now it only works on scraps.hackclub.com i made this because the website kept going and someone asked if someone can make it so i did and here it is!!!
